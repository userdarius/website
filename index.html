        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Darius, a computer science student at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>. I'm documenting my
          learning notes and thoughts in this blog:
          <a href="https://www.dariusfoodeei.com/">dariusfoodeei.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to think about the future and build things. I'll also be
          documenting some projects I work on here! Some of my interests include:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning</strong> This are fields I find very exciting. I believe the future of real world AI applied to industry and society lies in RL and I also think the economic impacts of learning control systems in industry will be huge. I also think AGI will require a lot of RL and not just scaling LLMs to become more autonomous and creative.</li>
            <li><strong>Decentralized Systems and Ethereum</strong> I've worked on this for a few years now and I think it's a very interesting technology with huge potential, however I'm not sure how much of a difference it will make in the short to medium term. I think we'll need a lot more innovation in web3 (and a major shift in mindset) to make it more than just a speculative internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Robotics</strong> I think humanoid robotics will be the next big thing to solve the labor shortages in the US. Personally I've worked on a few smaller projects like quadrupeds and robotic arms</li>
            <li><strong>Brain Computer Interfaces</strong> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.578875/full">(here's a link to a cool intro)</a> I'm not a neuroscientist but I believe BCI is a game changer for people with disabilities and will help us keep up with AGI and superintelligence once they become a reality</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In my past life, I cofounded a decentralized money market protocol called
          <a href="https://honey.finance/">Honey</a>. I've worked for
          <a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/arbitrum">Trader Joe</a> and
          <a href="https://www.gelato.network/">Gelato Network</a>.
          I've dabbled in Web3 and decentralized systems for a few years as a developer after
          getting roped in by friends during my bachelor's, but have had trouble seeing the impact of
          my work on the world and have since then decided to focus on more concrete problems. I still think blockchain has a huge potential and I own some bitcoin, but it's not something I want to work on in the long run by lack of interest in financial engineering (I'm not too convinced by the other supposed benefits of blockchain).

        <h2>Current Work</h2>
          <p> I'm currently diving deep into deep learning (no pun intended) and reinforcement learning (if you want to as well I recommend <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">this book</a> as well as Sutton and Barto's <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html">book</a>).</p>
          <p> I'm also working on an app called memo that gamifies the process of reading saved articles and threads (inspired by duolingo).</p>
          <p> I've built a multiclass classification model that can give pretty accurate predictions on skin lesions. You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/userdarius/noma">github</a>.</p>
          <p> At EPFL I am currently working on a research project with the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/">MLO lab</a> which I will write about soon.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
          I like music (a lot), here are some of my favorite artists: 
          <ul>
            <li>Black Sabbath</li>
            <li>AC/DC</li>
            <li>Drake</li>
            <li>The Doors</li>
            <li>Led Zeppelin</li>
            <li>The Beatles</li>
            <li>The Rolling Stones</li>
            <li>Jimi Hendrix</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Here is a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1sIib8CrIy2XAAD7MgUsp5?si=7c7b7f31fc65474e">playlist</a> I've made on spotify with mostly hard rock.</p>
        <p>I also like the gym and running. I've ran a couple 10k and I'm planning to do a half marathon in october 2024. I want to buy a harley one day. I use a 2021 M1 pro macbook pro as my main computer. If you want to buy a computer buy a mac. I hate windows (I've used windows for over 15 years and would never go back after moving to macos). Linux is cool too if you like to code.</p>
