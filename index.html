        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Darius, a computer science student at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a> currently working on CoT reasoning and dataset optimization for llms. I'm documenting my
          learning notes and thoughts in this barely populated blog:
          <a href="https://www.dariusfoodeei.com/">dariusfoodeei.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to think about the future and build things. I'll also be
          documenting some projects I work on here! Some of my interests include:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning</strong> These are fields I find very exciting. I believe the future of real world AI applied to industry and society will be game changing (some cool companies working on this include phaidra.ai and others) and I also think the economic impacts of self improving control systems in industry will be huge. I also think AGI will require a lot more than just scaling LLMs to become more autonomous and creative. "There are many problems in the world that are far too complex to hand-code solutions for.  I expect this to be a large branch of machine learning, and an important step on the road towards general intelligence." - Sam Altman (I don't agree on keeping ai researched closed though)</li>
            <li><strong>Decentralized Systems and Ethereum</strong> I've worked on this for a few years now and I think it's a very interesting technology with huge potential, however I'm not sure how much of a difference it will make in the short to medium term. I think we'll need a lot more innovation in web3 (and a major shift in mindset) to make it more than just a speculative internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Robotics</strong> I think humanoid robotics will be the next big thing to solve the labor shortages in the world. I've worked personally on a few smaller projects like quadrupeds and robotic arms but nothing close to terminators.</li>
            <li><strong>Brain Computer Interfaces</strong> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.578875/full">(here's a link to a cool intro)</a> I'm not a neuroscientist but I believe BCI is a game changer for people with disabilities and will help us keep up with AGI and superintelligence once they become a reality.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In my past life, I cofounded a decentralized money market protocol called
          <a href="https://honey.finance/">Honey</a>. I've worked for
          <a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/arbitrum">Trader Joe</a> and
          <a href="https://www.gelato.network/">Gelato Network</a>.
          I've dabbled in Web3 and decentralized systems for a few years as a developer after
          getting roped in by friends during my bachelor's, but have had trouble seeing the impact of
          my work on the world. I still think blockchain has a huge potential in finance and I own some bitcoin, but it's not something I want to work on in the long run by lack of interest in financial engineering (I'm not too convinced by the other supposed benefits of blockchain at least in their current form). I'll gladly talk about it if you want to though.
        </p>
        <p>I've also done some work in high school in astrophysics. Here is a <a href="https://www.vsmp.ch/bulletin/suche/Artikel/144/144_Drompt.pdf">link</a> to a paper I wrote on gravitational lensing and dark matter.</p>
        <p>Some articles and blogs I think everyone should read :
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f10n">How to do great work</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://situational-awareness.ai/">The decade ahead</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/ethos-divine-age?f=author">The ethos of the divine age</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.centauri-dreams.org/">Centauri Dreams</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me">What I wish someone had told me</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and painters</a></li>

        <h2>Current Work</h2>
          <p> I'm currently diving deep into deep learning (no pun intended) and reinforcement learning (if you want to as well I recommend <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">this book</a> as well as Sutton and Barto's <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html">book</a>).</p>
          <p> I'm also working on an app called memo that gamifies the process of reading saved articles and threads (inspired by duolingo).</p>
          <p> I've built a multiclass classification model that can give pretty accurate predictions on skin lesions. You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/userdarius/noma">github</a>.</p>
          <p> At EPFL I am currently working on a research project with the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/">MLO lab</a> which consists in the creation of a state of the art truly open source llm (dataset and pretraining pipelines as well, hi meta lol)</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
          I like music (a lot), here are some of my favorite artists: 
          <ul>
            <li>Black Sabbath</li>
            <li>AC/DC</li>
            <li>Drake</li>
            <li>The Doors</li>
            <li>Led Zeppelin</li>
            <li>The Beatles</li>
            <li>The Rolling Stones</li>
            <li>Jimi Hendrix</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Here is a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/dars2002?si=c8477e897726421a">link</a> to my spotify profile. I take great pride in my playlists.</p>
        <p>I also like the gym and running. I've ran a couple 10k and I'm planning to do a half marathon in october 2024. I like motorcycles (harleys) and cars (f1 fan).</p>
        <p>I use a 2021 M1 pro macbook pro as my main computer. If you want to buy a computer buy a mac. I hate windows (I've used windows for over 15 years and would never go back after moving to macos). Linux is cool too if you like to code. Just don't buy a windows.</p>
